M1:
The date of the computer competition has been set
for next Thursday. Could you do me a favor and call
the hotel we deal with to make reservations for three
rooms?
M2:
Sure,James. I will take care of it right now.But what
are you going to do about the meeting you have scheduled
with Mrs. Green? Do you want me to call her and cancel?
M1:
Oh， I Completely forgot all about her. You know, I can't
miss this meeting with her. It's too important. On second
thought, I think I'd better send Sam to Los Angeles to 
attend the competition with you. He has been working on
the presentation,and he should be able to make the 
presentation in my place.
M2:
You're right,but Sam might not be too happy to hear this.
I think he has a trip scheduled next week with Miss. Singh.

35-37
M:
Pam's Carpet Shop. How may I help you?
W:
Yes, I saw an ad about your special sale on the new
"easy clean" carpet. I would like to check them out,
but I forget your store's exact location. Could you tell
me how to get there from Emerson Street.
M:
Sure, we're at 110 Foster Street, just two miles up Broadway
from Emerson. We'll be closing for today in about 30 minutes,
so you may want to wait until tommrow to visit us. The sale last
all week, by the way
W:
I'll do that, then. That will also give me time to gather some 
color sample to bring with me.

38-40
W:
Okay,let me see if I have everything straight here. Your flight
is due to arrive next Tuseday on June 20 at 4:50 pm. You will spend
one night at Hilton Hills and be on the 11 o'clock flight out to 
London night,right?
M:
That's correct. I will spend a night in Paris to meet with Mr. Chretien
the first thing Wednesday morning to settle a couple of things before I
set out to London to close a deal with Mr. Connelly. I need you to make
sure you have all the documents ready for me when there.
W:
No problem. I've also called Mr. Chretien and told him that you would be
coming to see him, and he said he would have all the necessary documents
ready for you as well
M:
That's great. I have a gut feeling that I am going to land this contract.
I feel very good about it.

41-43
M:
Good Afternoon, i'd like to open new account at your bank.
W:
Of course, i'll need your photo identification. Do you have a Driver's 
license or ID card with you?
M:
Yes, here is my driver's license.
W:
Thank you. Now just fill out the application form while I make a copy of
your driver's license. I'll be back very soon.

44-46
M:
Excuse me. This line doesn't seem to be moving. Have you been waiting long?
W:
Yes, much long than I expected. I need to get back to office, but I also 
have to make a deposit. For some reason my bank card isn't working, so I
can't use the automated machine.
M:
That's too bad. I have to withdraw some money. But I have an appointment with
friend in a few minutes. I guess I'll just comne back around 4 o'clock.
W:
Good idea. The bank should not be crowded then. I'm going to stay and wait. I 
wish they had more tellers working though.

47-49
W:
Excuse me, sir. Do you know how to get to Center for Adult Education? The 
registration form says it's on 100 Jackson Court, but I don't see Jackson on
my map.
M:
Jackson is a narrow alley right across from Delaware Park near Hooper Street.
If you use the park's walk path, it's pleasant 15-minutes walk from here. I'd
recommend going taht way. Otherwise, it's just 5 minuts away via Lincoln Avenue.
W:
Well, I do have some time. But I'm afraid it's going to start raining any moment,
and I have no umbrella. I guess I'll take the faster way. Thanks a lot for your 
help.
M:
No problem. Have a nice afternoon.
