This is Mary Williams with the MBS hourly forecast.
We are expecting some changes to the cold weather wave 
we had recently. A warm front is moving in and we'll
be experiencing some mild temperatures today. We
expect the High to reach 20 degrees Celsius. However,
I still recommend that you dress warming ,especially
if you are spending more than a few hours outdoors.
These temperatures will likely stick around for a few
days. I will have details on what the rest of the weeks's
forecast look like after hearing a message from sponsors.
